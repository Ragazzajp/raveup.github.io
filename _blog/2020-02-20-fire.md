A fire erupted in a warehouse based in Banning, California on Thursday morning, destroying what was formerly one of two lacquer production facilities in the world. Lacquer discs, an essential component of the lacquer vinyl pressing process, are aluminum discs that contain grooves cut from a mastered sound file. The last remaining company that can do these productions, MDC, is located in Japan.

The chemicals released from the burning vinyl, which contains a toxic plastic called PVC, raised environmental concerns for neighboring businesses and schools within a 3000 foot perimeter of the building. The highly hazardous fire was finally stamped out on Thursday afternoon, requiring the help of 80 firefighters. No employees were harmed in the event.

The Apollo Master website says, "To all of wonderful customers. It is with great sadness we report the Apollo Masters manufacturing and storage facility had a devastating fire and suffered catastrophic damage. The best news is all of our employees are safe. We are uncertain of our future at this point and are evaluating options as we try to work through this difficult time. Thank you for all of the support over the years and the notes of encouragement and support we have received from you all."
