Two songs of great and energetic pure KBD sound - inspired punk rock.

Born from the ashes of well-know bands such Transex and Silver Cocks, MEGA are the new rock'n'roll sensation in Roma. "You're Dead" is the proof of their insane genious, the b-side, "BMW" is a great anthemic midtempo with acid vocals and riff-guitar work.
Get in touch for their upcoming album... and be fast to grab this ltd. edition 7"!
