Directly from Roma, one of the early italian punk bands! Authentic &#x27;prime movers&#x27;, born in 1978, were led by Lucifer, a great vocalist inspired by Iggy Pop and David Bowie.

Authors of a punk style inspired by Damned, have climbed the ladder of its kind, coming after sounds more &#x27;new wave&#x27;, and finally dissolved in 1983. This is their album, a collection that takes its name from their &quot;war anthem&quot;, the song &quot;New Hedonism&quot;. The anthology, containing recordings dated 1979-81, is a real piece of the history of punk and post-punk in Italy!
