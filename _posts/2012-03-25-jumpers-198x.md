The &#x27;Punk&#x27; style became quite popular in Milan only after the Adam and the Ants concerts in 1978. After this event (15th/16th october), the local kids became conscious that build a &#x27;punk scene&#x27; in town was finally possible.

Of course, some bands were started before those nights (see Decibel, that were the official supporters of the Ants). But &#x27;our&#x27; focus in this story is dedicated to Mittageisen, Gags, TV Vampire, Jumpers, 198X. This album contains three tracks recorded in studio of Jumpers (more punk, in the same vein of Clash, Pistols) and rare sessions of 198X, a band inspired by Wire/Siouxsie and the Banshees/Adam and the Ants that were connected with  Mittageisen, Gags. TV Vampire. This album is a true &#x27;missing link&#x27; for all the euro-punk fans!
