Charlie ‘Ungry were performing in the UK during the late 70s and early 80s. The band’s music was based around the songwriting and musical arrangements of Tony Sando and Jeff Gibbs.

The concept being to move away from the Wham Bam of some of the Heavy Metal bands around at the time. The songs and the Charlie ‘Ungry sound are what might be called Heavy Metal with sensitivity, a strange and unique combination for that era. Charlie ‘Ungry’s first single ‘House On Chester Road’ was released in the summer of ’78 and had limited success, reaching number 17 in the Independent Charts in the UK. This release created a tremendous interest in the band, its music and inimitable sound. The single was lifted from an earlier demo tape recorded with the help of ‘Tubular Bells’ producer Tom Newman at Argonaut Studios in London. The recordings are all live in the studio with minimal overdubs and were completed in one day, warts and all! This album is a snapshot of that day in the summer of 1977 and the songs have been transferred with no re-mastering from a rather dusty original tape.
