Los Angeles greatest glam punk band! You can hear the sound of this band on &quot;Saturday Night Pogo&quot; (originally on Rhino records).

The album contains the 1978 single &quot;Polaride Picture/Popular Boy&quot; + nine studio unreleased songs recorded in the same years and hot live tracks. Essential for every late &#x27;70&#x27;s punk rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll fan!
