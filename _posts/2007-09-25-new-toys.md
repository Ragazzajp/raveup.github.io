Influenced by Dead Boys & Heartbreakes, New Toys were leaders of the late 70s punk movement in Buffalo.

Leaded by a young Kevin K (Road Vultures and many others projects) and his brother Alan (Grimm Reaper, Aunt Helen) the band was reaching their pinnacle in late 1980, opening up for Ramones, Dead Boys, Babys, Romantics & Squeeze. This album contains studio material (1981) + two live tracks at CBGB. Absolutely a 'must' for every NYC punk fan!
