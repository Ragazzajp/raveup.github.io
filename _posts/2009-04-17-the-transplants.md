Arghhhh!!!! This is a fuckin' masterpiece!!! Transplants were an obnoxious band from Boston.

Well, tryin' to imagine a bunch of doped long haired that play a dirty mixture of crude punk rock and savage '60 garage punk. Nobody knews this incredible band but Rave Up discovered for your pleasure one of the most terrific punk bands ever! 14 Studio tracks recorded in 1980!
