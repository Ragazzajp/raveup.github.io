Arghhhh!!!! This is a fuckin' masterpiece!!! Transplants were an obnoxious band from Boston.

Well, tryin' to imagine a bunch of doped long-haired guys that play a dirty mixture of crude punk and savage '60 garage. Nobody knew them, but Rave Up discovered for your pleasure one of the most terrific punk bands ever! Enjoy these 14 incredible studio tracks recorded in 1980!
