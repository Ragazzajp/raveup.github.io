Philadelphia&rsquo;s punk rock finest band! Started in 1977, the band was really popular at the &lsquo;The Hot Club&rsquo;, one of the main punk venues in USA.

They had a punk ethos, but laced with a potent pop mentality and a big sense of pure theatricality that reminded one of suck disparate outfits as Sparks, The Weirdos, Lance Loud&rsquo;s Mumps and The Dickies, not to mention The Monkees! Unfortunately the band recorded only one acetate and few studio tracks that you can find in this anthology that contains the best production of their unlucky career!!! Pure US punk genius, grab this!!!
