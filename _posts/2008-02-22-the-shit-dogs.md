Baton Rouge (Lousiana) ramonish long haired punks maniacs. Their discography is well know in the &quot;Killed by Death&quot; fans area.

This collection include their mega rare &quot;History of Cheese&quot; EP, the 2nd one &quot;You Bet!&quot;, unreleased cuts and the amazing track &quot;Not Responsible&quot; that apperead only on &quot;New Orleans Necessary Experience&quot; compilation in 1981. Absolutely a must!
