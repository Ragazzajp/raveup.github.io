"The Mighty Plod" were formed in May 1972 by Colchester Musician Steve Greenfield. The original line-up was Michael Natkansk (drums), Martin Newell (vocals), Carl Symanski (bass), John Fitzsimons (guitar).

Their music was based on glam rocks hits of the day such as Slade and Sweet, and a selection of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll standards like &#x27;Johnny B. Goode&#x27; and &#x27;Shakin&#x27; all over&#x27; done in a fast thrash style. In 1975 the band recorded five studio tracks including the amazing &lsquo;Neo City&rsquo;. The Mighty Plod turned up again in a feature on lost treasures from the Glam Rock era, the most important bands that got away, in the January 2002 &lsquo;Record Collector&rsquo;. As a result of this In March 2003 RPM records released the &lsquo;classic&rsquo; compilation CD &lsquo;Velvet Tinmine&rsquo;, that includes 20 tracks selected by the music magazine.
