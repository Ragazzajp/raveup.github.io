Canadian punk rockers from Hell! This albums is the definive testament of one of the best bands from this country. 10 unreleased studio tracks + their mega rare three tracks EP from 1981.

If you are a fan of "Smash the State" compilations, you'll enjoy this record! Of course, vintage photos and liner notes written by Kevin Shannon, bass player of the band.
