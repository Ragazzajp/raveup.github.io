Punk Rock hit Phoenix, Arizona in a slow and violent way. The dirt brain mentality of &quot;rock&quot; fans in the area showed resistance to any new musical group that didn&#x27;t conform to the model.

Finally, after a Ramones show in town, four young guys decided starting to play punk rock: The Names were born! The band and headed into the studio. Songs like &#x27;Young Romantics&#x27;, &#x27;Love/Hate&#x27;, and the anthem &#x27;I Don&#x27;t Like Radio&#x27; gathered the band airplay on the AM radio station K-15. Bands such as the Rubber City Rebels, the Gears and many others came through the area and The Names opened for most of them. The last show of the band was on New Years 1980. The next day, the band became Red Squares, that recorded the amazing 7&rdquo; &#x27;Modern Roll/Time Change&#x27; (see American Lost Punk Rock Nuggets # 25). All studio tracks + 4 live cuts!
