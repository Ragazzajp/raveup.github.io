American Alternative Power Pop band DOUG DEREK &amp; THE HOAX were in existence for just a single year from 1980 to 1981, however it was during that time that they created some of the more catchy, hook-laden songs to be put down to tape in a recording studio in the state of Connecticut.

This obscure band&#x27;s &quot;debut album that never was&quot; has finally come to be - a 12-song, full-length collection of all original studio recordings being released for the first time an unprecedented 27 years after they were originally recorded!! If you like &lsquo;70&rsquo;s pop such Raspberries, Badfinger, Big Star and the classic power pop of the early eighties (Records, Romantics, Cheap Trick). This album will be a true milestone in your record collection! Grab this Lp sooner you can, only 500 copies around!!!!!
