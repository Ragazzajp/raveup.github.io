Arizona finest punk rock band! Red Squares were famous in the Phoenix area for their hot concerts. They opened for Clash, Plasmatics, Flamin' Groovies and many other bands.

The album contains their "rare as hell" 7" (Modern Roll / Time Change) + 8 unreleased studio tracks + 4 live recordings. GREAT!
