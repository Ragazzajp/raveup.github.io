Rave Up has finally discovered the legendary Eliot 'Spike' Kagan 1973 tapes! Yeah, the king of basament rock started their career looong time ago, and this is the proof!!!

Pure garage demented lo-fi rockn'roll at the same lavel of the garage rock masterpiece 'Kings of the Basement' album. Sloppy sound in the tradition of the rebellious rock'n' roll of the 60's! Great artwork. A "must have" for any punk and garage fan!!! "We're the Penetrators, we don't fuck around... Cause we're the number one band in this town!"
