Southern California Punk pioneers!!! Started in 1974 as &lsquo;Glass Onion&rsquo;, they were based in San Diego.

During the glorious years, the &lsquo;Kidz&rsquo; performed with the cream of the local punk bands of that era, such The Penetrators, The Dinettes, DFX2, Hitmakers,The Standbys, Gary and the Blind Dates, The X-Terminators and more... The guys released also two great records in 1979, the amazing single &lsquo;Get Out/Find Yourself a Way&rsquo; and &lsquo;Playground&rsquo; 7&quot; EP. The Cardiac Kidz are featured on two &lsquo;Killed by Death&rsquo; compilation albums which seemed to solidify their place in the historic annuals of the history of US Punk Rock. They just recently granted an interview to San Francisco&#x27;s Maximum Rock'n'Roll magazine. Buy or Die!!!!! Be fast, only 500 copies available!!!!
