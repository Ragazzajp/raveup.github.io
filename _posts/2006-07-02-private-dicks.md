Private Dicks were an amazing punk - power pop band from Bristol (UK). They formed in 1979 and in the same year they released one of the best UK punk pop 7"'s in that season, 'She Said Go' on Heartbeat records.

The band was discovered some years ago and bootleged on 'Killed by Death' serie, but also seriously produced by the 'cult' japanese label 1977 on cd. The band recorded also various GREAT quality studio material that you'll find here, in this amazing Lp. You can also hear the energy of the band with the three live tracks enclosed.Well, if you\'re a fan of Jam, Undertones, Buzzcocks... this band will change your 'homelife' !
