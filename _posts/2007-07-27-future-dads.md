Future Dads, formed in 1981 after the split of legendary Boston punk band Unnatural Axe, were influenced by Ramones along with longtime heroes like the Modern Lovers and Lou Reed.

The Dads gigged regularly at the Rat, the Channel, the Underground, Cantones, the Club, the Paradise, and the Inn-Square Men’s Bar on bills along with local bands and out-of-town acts like the Plimsouls, Plasmatics, Mo-dettes, Professionals, Wire Train, and Shrapnel. After recorded a great 7” and many other studio tracks, the band split up in 1982. So there you have it. A little snapshot in time, these songs provided the soundtrack for a ragged ride through the glory days of Boston’s underground rock scene fueled by alcohol, loud amps, and a love for rock and roll that is still with us today. Essential!!!!!
