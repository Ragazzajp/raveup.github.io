Rave Up records is proud to presents one of the greatest and obscure outfits of the early US punk scene... The Sinatras. Started in 1976, based in NYC, the band was quite popular at CBGB and MAX&rsquo;s KANSAS CITY.

Their sound was directly inspired from bands such NY Dolls and Heartbreakers. Pure NYC punk&rsquo;n&rsquo; roll sensations!!! This anthology contains 7 killer studio tracks and a bunch of &lsquo;live&rsquo; songs, recorded from a mixer desk. Be fast to order this punk classic... this item will be &lsquo;sold out&rsquo; in few weeks!!!!
