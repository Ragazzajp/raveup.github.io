Detroit 1974/76, this buch of long-haired youngsters played a loud and powerfull rock'n'roll strongly influenced by Iggy and the Stooges.

This album contains the best selection of their rare recordings. KILLER STUFF!!! "A band out to blow your head off; The Punks play in such a gut grabbing manner that your ear bones feel like there getting socked in the jaw and cunnilinguisized at the same time." (Air-Wreck Genheimer Creem Magazine, september 1976)
