Style Sindrome began to play in Rome in 1980, inspired by the new wave and post-punk music scene pioneered in the United Kingdom by such giants as Joy Division, The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees.

Anna and Stefano came from TM Spa, a rock band that had been among the winner of the First Italian Rock Festival in 1980, whereas Giorgio had been part of Electroshock, a well known Italian rock band in the late &#x27;70s. When Massimo and Raimondo joined in, the band emerged with the final line-up. The music of Style Syndrome is characterized by an unconventional and well-balanced mixture of dark sensibility and psychedelia, as well as an evocative alchemy of sounds which creates a rarefied atmosphere. The band self-produced a couple of demo tapes in the years &#x27;81 and 82. In 1982 RAI produced a videoclip featuring Style Sindrome for the show &ldquo;Mister Fantasy&rdquo;.Later on in the same year, Style Sindrome participated with the track &quot;Waving in the dark&quot; to the compilation &quot;Gathered&quot;, edited by Rockerilla and released by Electric Eye Record.The album &quot;Gathered&quot;, re-issued on CD by Spittle Records in 2007, was listed in 2012 by the Italian Rolling Stone Magazine, among the 100 most beautiful Italian records ever. &quot;A mysterious design&quot; collects 7 original tracks from the band&rsquo;s two self-produced demo tapes recorded in Rome in the years &#x27;81 and &#x27;82, which had largely remained unreleased and gone lost over the years. This invaluable release offers to fans a most rare pearl in the treasure chest of independent Italian music of the early 80s.
