Boston punkers rules again! This album contains a marvellous selection of their best tracks recorded between 1978-81. Their sound is a great mix of power pop and punk'n'roll in the same vein of Real Kids.

The band was leaded by Frank Rowe (Baby's Arm) and Billy Borgioli (Real Kids rhythm guitarist). All studio recordings (including a great unreleased version of DMZ ëHow Do You Knowí), cool photos and extensive liner notes written by Carl Biancucci (Johnny and the Jumper Cables bassist). ESSENTIAL!!!
