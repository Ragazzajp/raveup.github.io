Wow, Eliot Kagan of Syracuse's Penetrators solo project!This album contains all studio songs in pure demented garage punk style.

All the tracks were recorded in 1981. If you liked "Kings of Basement Rock" this Lp will be another "must" in your Rave Up collection.Remember: "We are Penetrators, We are number one!"
