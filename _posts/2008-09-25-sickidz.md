A Philadelphia-based punk rock band formed sometime back in the late 1970's. Four teenagers in love with The Cramps, Stooges, ’60 garage punk and of course the first wave of punk rock.

This bunch of guys were Mick Cancer, Alison (the) End, Tim Trauma and Rich Lustre. Their apocalyptic theatrical performances became popular in Philly/N.Y.C underground circuits (Hot Club, CBGB, Max’s), opening for punk illuminaries as The Cramps, Iggy Pop, Gang of Four, Contortions, Siouxsie and The Banshees, The Dead Kennedys etc... After their first 7” ‘Rhythm Gurl’ released in 1981, Lux Interior and Poison Ivy Rorschach produced their classic ‘I Could Go To Hell For You’ EP in 1983.This anthology contains the best of their 1979-84 studio recordings.VOODOO PUNKERS NEVER DIE! HERE ARE THE SICKIDZ!!!
