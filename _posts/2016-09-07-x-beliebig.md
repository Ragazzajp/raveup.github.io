X-Beliebig - Cranky guitar sounds, archaic drums, and dark and threatening lyrics. That was X-Beliebig! Founded in the 1980's, the post punk band trip was the Austrian version of Joy Division.

Their album 'x-beliebig' was a groundbreaking milestone for the Austrian New Wave scene, with lyrics still relevant in today's society. The single 'Leben ist Blut' (Blood is Life) became well-known in the underground scene. It was one of their top hits. Martin Blumenau, from the Austrian radio station FM4, agrees with that stating: 'The best unknown Austrian band from back in the day. X-Beliebig.'
