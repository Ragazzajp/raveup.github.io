Formed in 1978, Latex Novelties were the first punk band in in Indianapolis!

Influenced by glam greats (NY Dolls/Bowie) and early british punk bands such Vibrators and Sex Pistols, they became immediately "the must-see" band for every person seeking an escape from the terrible musical scene in town during those days. This collection contains 12 great studio tracks recorded in 1978/82 + two live cuts. Great and pure "Killed by Death" punk rock, absolutely never released before!
