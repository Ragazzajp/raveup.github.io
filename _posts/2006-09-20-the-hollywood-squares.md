Finally out the killer selection of unreleased studio material of this amazing Los Angeles punk band.

The album contains also their kick'ass single released in 1979 that included the "all time" punk classic "Hillside Strangler". All the tracks are taken from original masters! Be fast to order, this record is going to be "sold out" in few days!
