Finally available on vinyl again the Minneapolis finest rock'n'roll band ever! This double Lp contains the best live performances of these great american punk prime movers.

Two incredibly full of energy live set perfectly recording at 'Jay's Longhorn' in November 1978. Great arwork and inner sleeve with lotsa of pics and infos. A CLASSIC!
