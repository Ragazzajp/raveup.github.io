Recent project from the east end of Rome with an acid and minimal synth punk's sound!

This duo is the collaboration between Gabor (voice) and Bob Junior (synth and drum machine).
HOLIDAY INN bears the shapes and scares that unauthorized buildings have imposed to the Roman suburbs, which once were promised a gleaming growth. It’s nostalgic and nasty, and will not have a bright future.
