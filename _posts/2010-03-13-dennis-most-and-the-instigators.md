Incredible all studio recordings album from these Massachussets geniuses! Their powerful and sleazy sound in 14 tracks.

Their definitive collection that include the incredible "Excuse My Spunk" 7" and more others kick-ass tunes + one live track, recorded in 1976. Great vintage photos and biography written by Dennis Most himself!
