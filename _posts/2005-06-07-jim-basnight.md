The Moberlys started playing around Seattle in the fall of 1978. The band was leaded by the great songwriter Jim Basnight. Eighteen studio tracks recorded between 1980-83.

Stellar power pop, an album full of hits such &#x27;Live in the Sun&#x27;, &#x27;LonesomeCrying Sigh&#x27;, &#x27;I Want you&#x27; and others... Perhaps one of the best power pop bands of the late seventies/early eighties ever! Perfect and marvellous sound!
