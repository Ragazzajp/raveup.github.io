Aqui del Rock first appearance was on April '78 in a rock festival in Lisbona, described by the press as 'anarchic and chaotic noise!'.

Some of their AMAZING tracks were bootleged on 'Killed By Death' volumes, but this is the only chance to get all their music with PERFECT sound quality supported by infos and pics! BE FAST, this band is one of the top european 'cult' punk bands ever and also a future 'collector's item for E-Bay punks!' Limited 500 copies on Red vinyl!
