Deca's is a project of Federico De Caroli's, started in the early Eighties. "Modulectron" is an anthology of unreleased material recorded between 1984-1986, a small jewel of Italian electronic music of the ‘golden age’.

He moved from the spacey and melodic style influenced by Jarre, Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk, Cosmic Couriers to experimental sound, involving elements of industrial, noise, "musique concrete" and even Dark Ambient. His extensive discography ( vinyls, tapes and cd’s ) is the representation of his creative genius that makes Deca one of most interesting musicians in the world of electronic music. As he says: “The artistic soul of a musician never dies, it hardly loses its spirit, actually, it is quite the contrary, and it can only grow with time: you can find new forms of inspiration, try new musical routes, mix new and old sounds together. The tracks of ‘Modulectron’ still feature the sound of my first pioneering tape recordings of 25 years ago”. Order this record right now!!! Only 400 copies available!!!
