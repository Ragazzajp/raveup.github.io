The Users were from Cambridge and formed in September 1976. Their sound was a mixture of The Stooges, New York Dolls, Rolling Stones and the Sex Pistols.

Young and with attitude - and plenty of it. Their first single &lsquo;Sick Of You / In Love With Today&rsquo; was released in May 1977 in a cool picture sleeve, received great reviews in the press and played many times by John Peel on BBC. Their 2nd single &lsquo;Kicks in Style&rsquo; was released in 1978 on Warped records, then the band split-up. This sampler contains their best recordings including some great unreleased studio tracks!!!!
