The Streetkidz were a bunch of NYC rockers that released only one rare EP in 1981 with three tracks (Go To School / Easy Way Out / In The IRA) on their own label (CK).

Their sound is a mix of punk and hard rock in the same vein of many NYC band of the period.The MC5, Stooges, NY Dolls, and the punk explosion of the mid to late 1970s were the main inluences of the band that was quite popular at Max&#x27;s Kansas City and CBGB. This anthology contains ALL STUDIO MATERIAL, and it will be a &#x27;must&#x27; for every fan of Dictators and original NYC punk rock! Dig it fast!!!!
