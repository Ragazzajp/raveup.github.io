Milwaukee 1980-1982 power pop! The Sidewalks (also released on CD by the "guru" of the history of american New Wave, Chuck Warner) complete studio sessions.

Fifteen amazing tracks that includes their rare and great single "Natalie". If you like bands like The Nerves, Gary Valentine, The Shivvers, these guys will broke your heart! Great straight-ahead garage-pop with cool lyrics. Be fast to grab this album... will be sold out soon!
