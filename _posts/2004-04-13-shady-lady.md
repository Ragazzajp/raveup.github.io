Los Angeles premier glam rock band! Rodney Bingenheimer wrote about these longhaired freaks ‘they were the first and true underground band in Los Angeles‘.

Their drummer went to play in the legendary shi-fi glam band Zolar-X! The tracks were recorded between 71/73. All studio stuff, no live cuts! Amazing full cover shocking artwork! Sons of the Dolls, let's buy!
