Unreleased recordings by original UK punk bands are becoming increasingly hard to find, so it was with great excitement when I came across a metal tape reel with “No Way – July '79” scratched into it.

One digital transfer later and I was listening to a twelve-song session by a band who were so cruelly ignored in 1979. Their sole 7” single released back then entitled “Breaking Point” is a pulsating punk tune, backed with the equally glorious “30 Seconds” and “TV Pox” - stomping versions of all three feature on this 12 song set, recorded in one drunken afternoon at the BBC Studios in Middlesbrough, UK. No Way were Paul Callan (bass), Paul Gardner (guitar), Pete Collins (drums), and Marty “Matey” Powell (vocals), sadly Marty passed away in 2007, but Paul and Pete still play gigs as No Way. They had one of the tightest rhythm sections on the UK punk scene, and you can clearly hear the influence of The Sex Pistols, but this band have a strident energy that is all their own, and after 36 long years gathering dust, this precious piece of punk history can finally be unleashed.
