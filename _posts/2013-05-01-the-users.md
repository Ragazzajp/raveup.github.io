In 1977, Cambridge record dealer Lee Wood founded Raw Records, and quickly recorded The Users in March of the year, releasing the single "Sick of You / I'm In Love Today" on May 5, 1977.

Sounds magazine stated that it "burns into your brain without compromise." Despite only releasing two singles and being active for less than three years, the band developed a lasting cult following. BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel placed their first single Sick of You in his chosenFestive Fifty chart of 1977, and after his death it was revealed that he'd kept it as part of his fave singles of all time! Rave Up is now proud to release and EP with four unreleased tracks of these monsters of UK punk rock. BE FAST TO GRAB THIS JEWEL, ONLY 400 COPIES AVAILABLE!!!!!
