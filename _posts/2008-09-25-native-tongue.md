Pure genius from Massachusetts! The band formed by Michael Frackleton (drums, vocals), Louis Selvitella (bass, vocals) and Lee Leffler (guitar) was influenced by Gang of Four, PIL, ‘No Wave’ bands and reggae music (!).

In 1981 the band released the self-titled EP on Detante Records. Their second wax, "YOWL", a ten song album on Modern Method Records came out the year later.Their sound can be described as ‘high-powered, stripped down, formed by layering bass and guitar over a steady drum-based dance beat with pleasant dissonant vocals’ (Boston Rock magazine 1981).This album contains 15 great studio tracks recorded during their short but intense life.IF YOU ARE A FAN OF MISSION OF BURMA, MODERN LOVERS, THE GIRLS ETC... YOU CAN’T LOSE THIS PIECE OF THE HISTORY OF BOSTON UNDERGROUND MUSIC SCENE!
