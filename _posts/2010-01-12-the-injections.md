Another big shot from your fave label! The S.Diego cult band is finally available on Rave Up catalogue. The album contains their mega rare sigle and the re-mastered lost album recorded in 1980!

Totally raw DIY sound from Southern California. Liner notes written by the Radiactive Label boss, Mr.James Bastard Wood. Essential!
