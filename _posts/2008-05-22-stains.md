Portland (Maine) snotty and crude kick ass punk rock. These weirdos recorded one ultra rare EP in 1980 plus lotsa killer unreleased studio material.

This is the definitive collection of their early recordings. An album that will be a masterpiece for every true "Killed by Death" punk fan. 100% raunchy, obnoxious american punk rock!!
