NYC mid seventies glam rockers! Rick Rivets (who played guitar also in the legendary New York Dolls) cult band!

During those hot days the Brats opened many times for Kiss and Alice Cooper live shows. One of the seminal punk bands of the NYC rock'n'roll scene. All their studio recordings and some live tracks are included in this killer album. Liner notes written by Whiplash label owner Andy Doback. Buy it or die!
