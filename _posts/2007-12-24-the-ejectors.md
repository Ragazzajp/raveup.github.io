This great anthology contains one of the most collectable Texas punk bands ever! The Ejectors came from Fort Worth and released the mega-rare and great single "Hydrohead" in 1981.

These 12 great studio tracks where recorded in the same year. After 25 years these recordings are available for all the true punk maniacs. Texas punk at maximum attitude!
