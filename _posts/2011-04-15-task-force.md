Following a couple of gigs the band returned to the studio on 6th december and recorded their 2nd demo which included &lsquo;Not so Brave&rsquo; &lsquo;Tap Dance&rsquo; and &lsquo;Face of the West&rsquo;. In the same month, a local label produced the e.p &lsquo;Rock n Dole&rsquo;, which featured TASK FORCE &#x27;Fresh Air&#x27; and three other local bands: Obnoxious Tartus, Decade Waltz&rsquo; and Hot Banana.
